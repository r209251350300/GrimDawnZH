The weak ones hide in the shadows, skulking about tombs searching for their next meal.{^n}{^n}But it is the greater ghouls that should strike terror into the hearts of man. They do not fear the sun, do not fear flame. They are the nightmares with which we must contend.{^n}{^n}One such ghoul, we call it Abathis, has been wandering 古代墓地. For the sake of Cairn herself, it must be slain.{^n}{^n}Abathis' elimination will be amply rewarded with materials from our stores.
