            Arkovia is proof of the unbridled power, and hubris, of humanity. An entire race of people damned to eternal damnation out of the sheer spite of one man. But enough on that.{^n}{^n}Deep within the ruins known as the Steps of Torment, there is a spirit called Alkamos. He played a central part in Arkovia's fate, and now pays the eternal price at the heart of the prison he once maintained.{^n}{^n}For centuries, his hatred for Uroboruuk had boiled his mind into madness. He is now an uncontrollable weapon, primed and ready to be unleashed. See that this never happens.{^n}{^n}Travel into the Steps of Torment and banish the Lord Executioner. Survive the encounter and I'll even reward you with something from my most treasured collection.{^n}{^n}This bounty requires a Skeleton Key.
