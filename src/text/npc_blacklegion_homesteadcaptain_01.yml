            Hah! That's a bit blunt, but true. The First Blade, or rather, Ulgrim as he calls himself now, has a bit of a history with the Black Legion.{^n}{^n}Most famously, I suppose, was the time he executed a Black Legion captain for taking no prisoners during a civilian uprising. We had no direct orders to capture the rebels but the... more efficient route our captain chose seemed to strike a chord with Ulgrim. I find it rather ironic though given his line of work.The emperor was displeased with the First Blade's actions, but no formal punishment was ever deemed necessary, which did not sit well with my superiors.
        譯文 : >-
            哈！你這話說得有點不客氣了，不過很對。帝國第一刃，或者更準確的說，這個艾格瑞姆現在自封的名號，跟黑色軍團是有些淵源的。{^n}{^n}我覺得，最有名的莫過於他擅自處決了一名黑色軍團的隊長，原因是在一次平民起義期間，這名隊長沒有抓捕起義軍並將他們投進監牢裡。因為我們並沒有接到直接的命令要把反抗軍都給抓起來，所以……我們的隊長相信艾格瑞姆還擁有些惻隱之心。不過對於艾格瑞姆這號人來說，我覺得這種想法實在是一種諷刺。皇帝雖然對第一刃的行為感到有些不滿，但是卻沒有人認為需要給他任何正式的處罰，這讓我的長官們感到難以接受。

            The Black Legion, like its history, is a dark and conflicted thing. During the Time of Troubles, when the empire was pressed by war on three fronts, refugees overwhelmed the capital and political dissent among the noble houses threatened to tear the government apart, thousands were imprisoned for political reasons, petty crime or just vagrancy. The prisons were overflowing and the military was crumbling for lack of recruits. I'm not sure anyone can remember who but someone, probably some bureaucrat, came up with the novel solution of sending the prisoners to fight on the front lines and supposedly win absolution.{^n}{^n}Most were unfit for battle and simply served as cannon fodder, shielding the regular units' advance, but some survived and did, indeed, win their freedom. Many more deserted though and eventually wound up back in prison. The empire corrected these imperfections though with the aid of the Luminari, who devised a process to essentially imprison the human will itself; mentally binding people into the service of the empire. They created a name, insignia and ritual to reinforce this desire to serve and thus was born the Black Legion.The detachment from personal life, unwavering sense of duty and unparalleled experience in the front lines of the harshest battles killed off the unfit and forged whoever remained into one of the most elite fighting regiments in the known world. The title "Death's Bannermen" was not handed out lightly. In time, because of our guaranteed loyalty and proven effectiveness in combat, we became the favored legion of the emperor himself; often at odds with the Erulan military high command and feared by the noble houses.{^n}{^n}You may be wondering now whether I've gone through the mental conditioning I spoke of and the answer is yes. I'm conscious of it all, I know I've been conditioned to be a loyal soldier but that knowledge doesn't change the feeling and I'm not sure it even matters. We are now what we are and, in all honesty, I can't say it is for the worse. {^n}{^n}I was a spoiled and deluded girl once. Heiress to one of the great houses of Erulan. I ended up in the legion due to my own and my family's betrayal of the empire and since then, my eyes have been opened to the larger world and I have found a true purpose. At one point, many years ago, my uncle abducted me from the legion, attempting to liberate me. In the end, I escaped and returned to duty. Despite the horrors I've seen, the spartan life and endless toil; the legion is like a drug that, once tasted, can't be quit.

Now we struggle on in a world worse for its passing and can only hope to some day recapture that glory.

            What I remember most is the screams. Innocents being slaughtered by the thousands. Rifts opening up all over the place and spilling out fiends unlike any mankind had ever seen.{^n}{^n}It wasn't a battle. It was a massacre. Most of the imperial forces still stationed within the capital did not survive the initial attack. Many more fell while trying to flee from the doomed city.{^n}{^n}The Black Legion's Commander Tarkis stayed behind to rally a defense while we made our retreat. It was a noble sacrifice and one I will never forget.

            我印象最深的就是那些人的慘叫。數以千計的無辜的人被殺死了。遍佈四處的裂隙中湧出人類從未見過的惡魔。{^n}{^n}那根本不是一場戰鬥，而是一場單方面的屠殺。帝國絕大多數的武裝力量都駐紮在首都，因此都沒能在最初的攻勢中倖存下來。更多的人在試圖逃離那個末日般的城市的過程中死掉了。{^n}{^n}黑色軍團的指揮官塔基斯組織起了抵抗力量為我們殿後，我們才得以成功撤退。那是一次偉大的犧牲，我永遠都不會忘了他。

Since then he's been helping to coordinate our resistance and providing valuable insights into the nature of our supernatural foes.

            I wouldn't say he's an expert; no one is. The Aetherials were largely unknown until the Grim Dawn. That's part of the reason they succeeded so well in infiltrating and defeating the empire.{^n}{^n}However, Creed is one of the few surviving people who had experience with them before the Grim Dawn and, apparently, he was able to find some references to them in old texts stored in the vaults of the Luminari. We still learn new things about them every day though and they continue to find ways to surprise us. We're still not entirely sure where they came from...

            沒人是虛靈專家，他也不例外。在恐怖黎明發生之前，我們對它們一無所知。這也是它們如此成功地侵入並擊敗帝國的原因之一。{^n}{^n}不過在倖存下來的人裡面，克里德是恐怖黎明之前就跟虛靈打過交道的人員之一。顯然，他是在光明會的寶庫之中找到了關於虛靈的古籍。我們每天都會學到關於它們的新東西，可是它們還是能不斷刷新我們的認知。我們仍然不知道它們到底來自何方……

That same year we marched all the way to their capital, and crushed them. That was the end of the North Wars.

            The Legion is split on two fronts. To the north, we have the Cult of Ch'thon. Nasty bastards keen on turning all of us into a puddle of blood for their rituals. I have my best men out there right now, scouting ahead. The cultists are amassing in great numbers, and I'd like to know why.{^n}{^n}There is a more pressing issue, however, and this is where you come in. Ulgrim says that you are experienced with fighting the Aetherials. That's good. You'll need all your skills for this one. Far to the west, beyond the Infested Farms and the 腐壞田地, there is an area teeming with Aetherials that we have started calling the Gruesome Harvest. It is a fitting title as the Aetherials have been gathering corpses, animal and human alike, in order to conduct their sick resurrection techniques upon them.{^n}{^n}The barn there has been giving off a blinding aether light nonstop for the last few days and nights. That is, until today. Whatever they are working on, it must be nearly finished. And knowing the Aetherials, it's something monstrous.{^n}{^n}We can't risk the Aetherials discovering that we know about their creation. I need someone to sneak in there and destroy this abomination before it even has a chance to wreck havoc upon my people. We'll only get one shot at this, so I want someone who has experience dealing with Aetherial horrors to handle this mission.{^n}{^n}Will you be my champion?
